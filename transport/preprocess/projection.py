    """Project stops onto the nearest roads and split those roads at stop locations.

    For each stop, the function finds the nearest road geometry. If the stop is within
    `max_distance` of that road, the road segment is split at the stop's projected
    position along the line. Stops farther than `max_distance` from any road are
    removed. Returns the updated road layer (with split segments) and the filtered
    set of stops.

    Parameters
    ----------
    roads_gdf : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame with road geometries (LineString). Must have a valid projected CRS (meters).
    stops_gdf : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame with stop point geometries. Will be reprojected to `roads_gdf.crs`.
    max_distance : float, optional
        Maximum allowed distance (in meters) between a stop and its nearest road for the split
        to occur. Defaults to 70.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[geopandas.GeoDataFrame, geopandas.GeoDataFrame]
        (roads_with_splits, filtered_stops):
        - roads_with_splits: roads with segments split at accepted stop locations.
        - filtered_stops: only the stops within `max_distance` of a road, index reset.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function copies inputs; originals are not modified.
    - Make sure both layers use a projected CRS in meters for correct distance thresholds.
